# Master Project Development


This repository contains files that make up the execution of my master's project.
 
The project under development aims to analyze the performance of an algorithm based on XGBoost for predicting antimicrobial resistance using pieces of conserved genes (kmers).

The goal is to investigate whether conserved genes closer to resistance genes in terms of protein interaction network have a better predictive power.
